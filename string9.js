// What is the error in this code ?


var b = "Hello this is my "
Dell Laptop ""
console.log(b);


// Here you will get
// SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
// Because we used the same double quotes inside to say Dell Laptop
// without "+" sign we can't add that



// var b = "Hello this is my " + "Dell Laptop " + ""
// console.log(b);



// this is right code
